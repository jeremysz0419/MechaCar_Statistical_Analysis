# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
AutosRUs created a new protytpe, the MechaCar, that is suffering from production troubles that is halting the manufacturing team's progress. We have been tasked to produce statistical analysis to help identify problems that can help the manufacturing team. We performed the following to assist the MechaCar. 
* find significant variables that identify MPG for prototypes;
* produce summaries on the PSI of suspension coils;
* analyze if the various manufacturing lots have a statistical "significance" as opposed to the entire mean population;
